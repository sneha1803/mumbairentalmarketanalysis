As the financial and commercial hub, Mumbai witnesses significant migration from other states. And most of the incoming population looks to rent houses. By the beginning of 2022 rental rates were on the rampage. Rentals have jumped 20-25 percent across most micro-markets1. The rental that paid for a 3BHK apartment in a particular building is enough now only for a 2BHK.

   "As per the report, 53% of tenants in Mumbai chose a home to rent based on its distance to their workplace, while 48% made the decision based on the ease of transportation to other parts of the city. A significant majority (58%) also highlighted the neighbourhood's safety quotient as an important factor while choosing a property," said Saurabh Garg, co-founder of NoBrokerTenants across Mumbai also gave due consideration to access to amenities while making their rental decisions. Around 85% looked for regular water supply at their new homes, while 76% wanted their homes to be secure.

   The regions that witness the maximum demand in Mumbai include Kharghar, Mira Road, Thane West, Majiwada, Kalyan West, Kandivali East and West, Ghodbunder Road, and Kharegaon. Other localities that see high rental activity include Mira Bhayandar, Badlapur West, Virar, Seawoods, Titwala East, Nalasopara, Borivali, Malad East, Nerul, and others. "Their popularity is driven by affordability, as prospective tenants can rent a 2BHK unit at an average monthly rent in the range of Rs 17,000 - 25,000," said Garg.
